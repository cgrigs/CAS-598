My names is Courtney Grigsby. I am a third year Biology PhD student, in Dr. Reed Cartwright's lab.

My research primarily focuses on methods and models for estimating de novo mutation rates. I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in biology and a minor in Computer Science from Southeastern Louisiana University. 

I am originally from Baton Rouge, Louisiana and I moved to Arizona in 2021, for graduate school. 

I have three dogs, Cash (10-year-old shih tzu), Stella (9-year-old, Staffordshire Terror), Sven (2-year-old Labrador Retriever). In my free time I like to stay active with my dogs and do small coding projects on the side.
